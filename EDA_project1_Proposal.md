### BackStory: 

  ```
  Vinny & Joan -

   It was great to meet you at the networking event last week. We’d love to take some next steps to see if working together is something that would make sense for both parties.

  As we mentioned, we are interested in harnessing the power of data and analytics to optimize the effectiveness of our street team work, which is a significant portion of our fundraising efforts.

  WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) has a summer gala in New York City each year. As we are a new and inclusive organization, we try to do double duty with the gala both to fill our event space with individuals passionate about increasing the participation of women in technology, and to concurrently build awareness and reach for our organization.

  To this end we place street teams at entrances to subway stations. The street teams collect email addresses and those who sign up are sent free tickets to our gala.

  Where we’d like to solicit your engagement is to use MTA subway data, which as I’m sure you know is available freely from the city, to help us optimize the placement of our street teams, such that we can gather the most signatures, ideally from those who will attend the gala and contribute to our cause.

  The ball is in your court now -- do you think this is something that would be feasible over the next two weeks? From there we can explore what kind of an engagement would make sense for all of us.

  Best,

  Karrine and Dahlia 

  WTWY International

### Questions/need

  + What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?

    Using MTA turnstile data to provide WTWY recommendations about the best subway stations to deploy their     street teams and increase the number of sign-ups for the WTWY gala. 

  + Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?

    WTWY in the first place is the first beneficiary from this EDA, then potential women who will attend their gala and have access to their resources

### Data Description
+ What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?

   Primarily MTA turnstile data obtained from (http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html.) 
   
+ What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? What characteristics/features do you expect to work with?
  This project was done by: 
  
        Nadia Alghamdi
        Manal AlQahtani

+ If modeling, what will you predict as your target? 

   There is no modeling in this project! 
   
### Tools:

+ How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project?

   By using SQLAlchemy, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, matplotlib
  
+ Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?

   Not at the moment!
  
### MVP Objective:

   The goal of this project is to better understand which NYC MTA subway stations have the most traffic.
